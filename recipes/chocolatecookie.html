        <h2>Ingredients You Will Need</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li> 
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix together cocoa, white sugar, and vegetable oil. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the cocoa mixture. Cover dough, and chill for at least 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper. Roll dough into one inch balls. I like to use a number 50 size scoop. Coat each ball in confectioners' sugar before placing onto prepared cookie sheets.

            </li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Let stand on the cookie sheet for a minute before transferring to wire racks to cool.</li>
